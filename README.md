# Notes-for-Networking
My notes while I'm learning about networks!



Networking today
---------------
- Our usage of phones and internet in general consumes a large time of our day, from the moment of waking up to the moment of going to sleep.
- Convenience, companies could switch from offline working to online working for more efficiency and reach.
- Practically, a world without boundaries, you could reach just about anywhere on Earth.
- Human networking. (expand on this later)

What is a computer network?
---------------------------
- There must be a connection between two or more computing devices with the purpose of transmitting data and sharing information.
- There are two ways to connect: physical wiring or wireless.
- Computing device ex: + computer, phone, server, tablet, tv...etc

v
as long as it has data, it can be a computing device and can share and transmit data.

- transmitting data ex: text, file, image, voice, video,..etc

computer network ex: downloading songs to phone using a wire (qualifies as a computer network)

Network components
------------------
Three main components:
1. End devices: Data originates here, then comes through no.2 before finally reaching another end device (end device = computing device)
2. Intermediary Devices: Used to connects end devices.
3. Network media: Transfer data into "waves", more specifically, electrical pulses for metal wires within cables, pulses of light with fiber-optic cables and electromagnetic waves with wireless transmission.

Intermediary devices example: Wireless router, LAN Switch, Router, Multilayer Switch, Firewall Appliance.

Router(or access point) usage: Makes sure the "path" is efficient and makes it's way to the intended end device. (VERY loose definition, needs further clarification).

LAN switch: is ONLY used for connecting, basically nothing else

Multilayer switch: connects using many more switches, aka more pathways aka a switch with many pathways pretty much it.

About VoIP phone: It doesn't take any "data" as a normal IP Phone, but only the sound through network?? (not sure, teacher goes on about it being fascinating but focused on other points after brief explanation)

Network Representation
----------------------
- Physical topology: the physical location of intermediary devices and cable installation.
- Logical topology: illustrates devices, ports, and the addressing scheme of the network.

fun fact about Russian for some reasons from teacher: u and y is said in reverse compared to how we(normal people) usually says it
